# Create SIP domain

The first step after installing the product is to create a domain name that you will use to connect your users to Twilio. The subdomain you specify is added to the domain sip.twilio.com, thus forming a unique name in Twilio's global namespace.&#x20;

**Field descriptions**:

* **Application**: The application that handles incoming calls from devices in this domain. By default, **SIP Domain Calls**, this application routes calls using the created extensions and outgoing rules.
